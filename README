irken is an IRC library for Python.

I know -- "another one?" Yes. I have no arguments. This is me reinventing a
wheel, and I think my skills are good enough to make a sufficiently improved
wheel.

Enunciation of the word "irken" isn't entirely obvious to non-North Germanic
people. Well, to anybody who isn't Swedish I suppose.

It's pronounced like "eer:khen" where the colon marks stress. That is to say,
it's first a sound like the vowel in "eel", but combined with a rhotic sound,
which isn't found in English at all, and then simply "ken".

But I guess it's fine to say "irk" and then make it an ongoing type of thing
with -en, like "She irkens me." But it's not how I (the namegiver) pronounce
it.
